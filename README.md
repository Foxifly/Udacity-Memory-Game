## Introduction

This memory game was designed for the second project of Udacity's Frontend Development Nano Degree program. This app runs on the browser and generates a matching game for users to play.

The goal of the game is to pair each card with a card that has a matching image. Once all matches have been made, the user will be rated based on how many moves were made and the time taken.

The purpose of this game is to gain proficiency with building front-end web applications to design a browser based game. This game utilized skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to build a fully functioning game.

## How To Play

To play this game, you want to click a card to see what icon shows on its face. If two faces match up, then it is considered a  match. If the cards don't match, they flip back over until the player finds the correct match.

Just like a lottery ticket, the player can opt to multiply their pretend cash winnings. To multiply winnings, the player needs to click on the multiplier card to reveal the multiplier will be. If the player uncovers a bomb, the game is over and no prize value will be distributed. This adds a risk factor to the game.

Once the game is complete, the player will be presented with a popup breaking down the score. They will be given the grand total of their pretend winnings and given the option to play again.
