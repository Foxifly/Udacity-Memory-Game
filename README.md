## Introduction

This memory game was designed for the second project of Udacity's Frontend Development Nano Degree program. This app runs on the browser and generates a matching game for users play.

The goal of the game is to pair each card with a card that has a matching image. Once all matches have been made, the user will be rated based on how many moves were made and given the opportunity to play again.

The purpose of this game is to gain proficiency with building front-end web applications to design a browser based game. This game utilized skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery to build a fully functioning game.
